Practicing git on EMACAS with magit.

* Discarding uncommitted changes

On the main magit buffer, (C-x g), the Unstaged changes are displayed per file.  Type Meta-N to get to the file that you wish to examine.  Then type Meta-TAB to open up a view of the uncommitted changes.  Then type Meta-N to get to the hunk - i.e. section - of changes that you want to undo.  Then type k to cancel the changes in that section.  Note: Meta-TAB toggles folding-unfolding of subsections.
